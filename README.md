# Virtual storage design kata

The objective of this kata is to design the classes and methods needed to model a simplified virtual storage that will contain files.

## Method
* This kata is incremental: **every 15 minutes a new requirement will be announced**, so developers have to
implement it (usually a new method to code) and rethink the classes' structure.
* There are **5 requirements**.
* This kata is intended to be done with **pair programming**, and at the end a discussion will be opened.
* You can use **any programming language** with object oriented programming.

## Let's start
Before starting: prepare your laptop with your development environment and your favourite tests libraries for the language you plan to use already installed.

* [Requirement one](../master/requirement-1/README.md)
