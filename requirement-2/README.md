# Virtual disk design kata
## Requirements reminder
* A Directory has a name and stores File(s). It can add and delete file(s).
* A File has a name (a string) and a size (an int).

## Requirement 2
* Directories can contain File(s) but also Directory(s). So generalize both as Resource(s).

## Next Requirement
* [Requirement three](../requirement-3/README.md)
