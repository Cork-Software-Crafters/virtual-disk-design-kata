#Virtual disk design kata
##Requirements reminder
* A Directory has a name and stores File(s). It can add and delete files, and get all files.
* A File has a name (a string) and a size (an int).

##Requirement 2
* Directories can contain File(s) but also Directory(s). So generalize both as Resource(s).

##Next Requirement
* [Requirement three](../blob/master/requirement-3/README.md)
